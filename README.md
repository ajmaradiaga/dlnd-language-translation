# Language Translation

In the project, we train a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French.

### Setup

Highly recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Anaconda conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.

This project has the following dependencies:
- Python 3.6
- Jupyter Notebook
- Numpy
- Tensorflow 1.1

After installing Anaconda, open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the repository is in your local machine.


```bash
cd /path/to/cervantes
conda env create -f dl-languagetrans.yml
```
